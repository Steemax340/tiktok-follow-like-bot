# TikTok Follow & Like bot POC

## Analysis
A few days I figured out, that of the biggest F4F sites doesn't use a captcha for account creation. Making an account gen was easy, with no mail verification. For some reason, every account can buy followers for 10 tokens, and go into the minus. Every account can only do it once tho, so the tool has to generate a ton of accounts.

This weirdly enough also works for likes, but not any other service on the site.

The result is a working follower bot. Slow, but working.

## Why am I releasing this?
No buyers. No motivation. I don't want to keep this source hidden from everyone until it's patched.
(also got scammed once while selling this lol)

## How do I run this?
```
Download the files
-> pip install -r requirements.txt
-> python follow.py
-> enter your username
-> enjoy!
```
